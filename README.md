Token Bucket Rate Limiting Algorithm:

üîç **What is the Token Bucket Algorithm?**
The Token Bucket Algorithm is a popular rate limiting algorithm used in distributed systems to control the rate at which requests are processed. It operates on the concept of a token bucket, where tokens are added to the bucket at a constant rate and consumed by incoming requests. If there are no tokens available, incoming requests are either delayed or rejected.

‚úÖ **Pros of Token Bucket Algorithm:**
1. **Smooth Rate Limiting:** The Token Bucket Algorithm allows for smooth rate limiting by allowing bursts of requests when tokens are available in the bucket.
2. **Simple Implementation:** It has a relatively simple implementation compared to other rate limiting algorithms, making it easy to understand and implement.
3. **Adaptability:** The algorithm can adapt to varying traffic patterns and handle bursts of requests efficiently without sacrificing overall throughput.

‚ùå **Cons of Token Bucket Algorithm:**
1. **Token Management Overhead:** Managing tokens and bucket state can introduce overhead, especially in high-throughput systems with millions of requests per second.
2. **Potential Latency:** In scenarios where the bucket is empty and requests need to wait for tokens to become available, there may be increased latency, impacting user experience.
3. **Risk of Resource Exhaustion:** If the token refill rate is too high, it can lead to resource exhaustion, causing the system to become overwhelmed during burst traffic.
